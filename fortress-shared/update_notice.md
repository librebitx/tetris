The map has been significantly widened to **30 columns** (900px width). 
This provides 50% more lateral space for players to maneuver and strategize.

Changes made:
- Increased `COLS` constant to 30 in both server and client.
- Updated canvas width to 900px.
- Adjusted spawn positions to ensure players start with enough separation (Red at 1/6, Blue at 5/6).
- Updated the Territory Bar to match the new width.

The server has been restarted. Refresh your browser to see the changes!
